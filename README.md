# ProofWrite

Project Description:
• We built a full-stack essay authenticity platform with fellow interns at Pinata’s hackathon, featuring 10-second auto-saves,
IPFS uploads via Pinata, and immutable CIDs for tamper-proof version histories to detect plagiarism and copy–paste.
• We scaled the platform with KV metadata storage linking version chains across multi-student, multi-assignment workflows,
optimized retrieval in React and Node.js for high-volume access, and won 1st place for innovative design and prototype.

Tech Stack:
• React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, REST APIs, IPFS, Pinata KV Storage
